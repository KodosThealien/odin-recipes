Training repo for TOP
I'm brand new to web design and coding. Decided to follow along on TOP a few weeks ago, mainly because it's free. I'm no young buck anymore but I'll be damned if I can't figure this stuff out. I may just be damned, lol. I've picked up enough HTML to accomplish the task but getting the basics of git and the command line has been difficult. Here we go!
